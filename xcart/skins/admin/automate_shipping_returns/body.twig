            <h2>Key Reasons for Automated Shipment Auditing</h2>
            <ul class="styled features">
                <li>E-Commerce sales are growing year over year resulting in more shipments to monitor & track</li>
                <li>Online consumers are requesting faster shipping methods which typically leads to increased costs as well as increased service failures</li>
                <li>Manually monitoring your shipments can cost your company time and money as well as missed opportunities for refunds due to the complexity of the reporting</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Did you know that FedEx and UPS shipments come with a money-back guarantee if delivered late by 60 seconds or more? Yet, an estimated $2 billion goes unclaimed annually due to the lengthy, overly-complicated process of claiming refunds. 71lbs proactively monitors your shipping accounts, identifies late deliveries, and files the claims on your behalf.</p>
        <p>Refunds are credited directly back to your account with the shipping carrier, and our fee is 50% of the collected refunds. No start-up cost. No monthly fee. No contract.</p>
        <p>Customers receive an easy-to-use dashboard on our website to view reports detailing your shipments, refunds, and more - all to assist with your shipping expense management. With an estimated 5% of shipped packages arriving late, monitoring the activity on your account with your carrier is important to your practiceâ€™s bottom line.</p>
