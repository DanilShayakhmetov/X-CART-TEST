<p>The installation script has not been able to detect <a href="http://php.net/" target="_blank">PHP</a> installed on your server. X-Cart requires [PHP] to operate, so, unfortunately, X-Cart installation may not be completed this time.</p>
<p>If you require assistance with this issue, simply <a href="https://www.x-cart.com/create-online-store.html?utm_source=XC5Install&utm_medium=noPHP&utm_campaign=XC5Install" target="_blank" onclick="javascript: ga('send', 'event', 'INFO', 'RequestPersonalDemo', 'no-php');">request a personal demo</a>, and our team will create a store for you.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with PHP and want to try your hand at installing X-Cart by yourself, consider using <a href="https://www.mamp.info/" target="_blank">MAMP</a> or <a href="http://wampserver.com/" target="_blank">WAMP</a> as your local server. You can also deploy your store on <a href="shttp://www.x-cart.com/hosting.html" target="_blank">X-Cart hosting</a> or deploy it on the servers of one of our <a href="https://partners.x-cart.com/hosting-companies?utm_source=XC5Install&utm_medium=noPHP&utm_campaign=XC5Install" target="_blank">hosting partners</a>.</p>
